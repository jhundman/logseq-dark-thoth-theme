# [logseq-dark-thoth-theme](https://github.com/jhundman/logseq-dark-thoth-theme)
 A dark theme for logseq with bright accent colors. 
 
 This was originally modified from the [logseq-allday-theme](https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme)(Nord) which is great and you should also check out.

 Currently I have not made any attempt to create/modify the light theme. Current implementation is dark theme only.

## Demo

## Install Instructions

To install simply download and replace the custom.css with the one found at root/logseq/custom.css in your own installation of logseq. You can also copy the code and within logseq go to Settings -> General -> Edit custom.css
