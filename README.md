# [logseq-dark-thoth-theme](https://github.com/jhundman/logseq-dark-thoth-theme)
 A dark theme for [logseq](https://github.com/logseq) with bright accent colors. Still a work in progress. 
 
 This was originally modified from the [logseq-allday-theme](https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme) which is great and you should also check out.

 I have not made any attempt to create the light theme. Current implementation is dark theme only.

## Demo

## Install Instructions

To install simply download and replace the custom.css with the one found at root/logseq/custom.css in your installation of logseq. You can also copy the code and within logseq go to Settings -> General -> Edit custom.css 

## Icons

In the icons folder, you will find modified images of the logseq mac icon. They were modified to match the color palette of the theme. To change the icon on a mac go to the application in Finder, right-click and select get info. From there drag the image file you want to the top icon shown in get info.
